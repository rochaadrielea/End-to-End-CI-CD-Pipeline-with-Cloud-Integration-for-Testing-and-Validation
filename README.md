# **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with Cloud Integration for Testing and Validation**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a CI/CD pipeline integrated with cloud deployment and testing infrastructure. It showcases key competencies required for the role of **Digital Solution Test Engineer / Systems Engineer**, including containerization, cloud services, and test automation.

The project focuses on automating the deployment of a sample web application to the Azure cloud using modern DevOps practices, simulating real-world IT integration and validation scenarios.

---

## **Features**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the application.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized application for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Application hosted on Azure App Service.
- **Automated Testing**: Basic integration and unit tests included in the pipeline.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Platform**: Azure App Service
- **Testing Tools**: Python’s `unittest` for automated testing
- **Programming Language**: Python (Flask-based sample app)

---

## **Key Steps**

### **1. Version Control and CI/CD Pipeline**
- Hosted source code in a GitHub repository.
- Configured GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

### **2. Containerization**
- Created a Dockerfile for containerizing the application.
- Tested the Docker container locally to ensure functionality.

### **3. Cloud Deployment**
- Deployed the Docker container to Azure App Service.
- Used Terraform (optional) to define infrastructure as code for Azure resources.

### **4. Testing**
- Developed basic integration and unit tests using Python’s `unittest`.
- Integrated the tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automated validation.

## **How This Aligns with Job Responsibilities**
This project aligns closely with the responsibilities and required skills for a **Digital Solution Test Engineer / Systems Engineer**:

- **IT Integration**: The project demonstrates IT integration by deploying a containerized application to a cloud environment with version control and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Testing and Validation**: Automated testing using Python’s `unittest` mirrors real-world validation processes.
- **Cloud and Virtualization**: Experience with Azure App Service and Docker highlights expertise in cloud services and containerized environments.
- **Documentation and Collaboration**: The clear structure and documentation of this project mimic stakeholder communication and documentation practices required for the job.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Build and Run the Docker Container Locally: Build and run the application locally to verify the container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t sample-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 sample-app
Deploy to Azure:

Follow these steps to deploy the application to Azure App Service:
Log in to the Azure Portal.
Create a new Azure App Service instance.
Deploy the Docker container using the Azure App Service container settings.
Optionally, use Terraform (provided in terraform/) to automate resource creation.
Run Tests:

Run local tests using unittest:
bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests/
Tests will also run automatically during the CI/CD pipeline execution.
